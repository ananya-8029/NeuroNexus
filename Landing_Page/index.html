      <h1>DID YOU KNOW!</h1>
      <div>
        <h4>The Great Wall of China</h4>
        <p>
          The original wall built under the rule of Emperor Qin Shi Huang of the
          Win Dynasty took around 20 years to finish. 21,196 kilometres long,
          the Great Wall witnesses highlands, landscapes, plateaus, natural
          barriers and more.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Christ the Redeemer, Brazil</h4>
        <p>
          Christ the Redeemer is a 125 feet tall statue designed by Heitor da
          Silva Costa, sculpted by French sculptor Paul Landowski. Since the
          statue is atop a mountain, it's prone to getting hit by lightning—in
          fact it gets hit around three to six times a year.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Petra, Jordan</h4>
        <p>
          A man made marvel, Petra is known as the Rose City, built out of pink
          sandstones. This structure, in fact is evidence that the Middle East
          was the most influential region of the world in the Middle Ages.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Machu Picchu, Peru</h4>
        <p>
          One of the most famous lost cities of the world, Machu Picchu, also
          known as the Lost City of the Incas, was built in 1450 and abandoned a
          hundred years after that.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Colosseum, Italy</h4>
        <p>
          Built between 70 AD and 82 AD by Emperor Titus Vespasian, the
          Colosseum in Rome is the most iconic, ancient amphitheatre in the
          world.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Chichen Itza, Mexico</h4>
        <p>
          Chichen Itza translates to “At the mouth of the well of Itza”.
          Believed to be the largest Mayan city ever built, the centre of the
          Chichen Itza comprises El Castillo, also known as the Temple of
          Kukulcan.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Taj Mahal, India</h4>
        <p>
          One of the most glorious displays of love in history is the Taj Mahal,
          built by emperor Shah Jahan in honour of his late wife.
